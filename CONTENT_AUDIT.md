## Minor Issues & Ambiguities

### 1. Task List Edition Naming
**Severity:** ⚠️ Medium  
**Issue:** The user referenced "BACB RBT Task List 5th Edition" — there is no 5th Edition of the *RBT* Task List. The content structure (A-01 through A-07, B-01 through B-21, C-01 through C-04, D-01 through D-05, E-01 through E-10) correctly matches the **RBT Task List 2nd Edition** (effective January 2024). The "5th Edition" label applies to the *BCBA/BCaBA Task List*, not the RBT Task List.  
**Action:** Verify the app's marketing/UI doesn't claim "5th Edition RBT Task List." The correct reference is "RBT Task List (2nd Edition)."

### 2. q142 — Scatterplot Task Code Assignment
**Severity:** 🟡 Low  
**Item:** `q142` — Scatterplot categorized under `A-01` (Prepare for data collection)  
**Discussion:** A scatterplot is a descriptive assessment tool. While it *is* a data collection method (making A-01 defensible), it functions more as an assessment instrument. The RBT Task List doesn't have a dedicated scatterplot task code, so A-01 is an acceptable placement.  
**Recommendation:** No change required, but consider adding a note that scatterplots are part of indirect/descriptive FBA methodology (relates to C-02 as well).

### 3. q267 — Mandated Reporting Procedure
**Severity:** 🟡 Low  
**Item:** `q267` — Correct answer states RBTs must "report suspected abuse or neglect to the appropriate authorities, even if they are not 100% certain"  
**Discussion:** This is legally correct — mandated reporters must report directly to authorities (e.g., CPS). However, some RBT study materials also emphasize reporting to the supervisor *and* to authorities. The current answer is not wrong, but some students may be taught to report to their supervisor first.  
**Recommendation:** Consider adding to the explanation: "RBTs should also notify their supervisor, but the legal obligation to report to authorities exists independently."

### 4. D-03 / E-01 Overlap — "Effectively communicate with supervisor"
**Severity:** 🟡 Low  
**Issue:** Both D-03 and E-01 have the same name ("Effectively communicate with supervisor"). The content handles them as separate contexts (documentation vs. professional conduct), which is correct per the Task List. However, this could confuse students.  
**Recommendation:** Add a flashcard or note explaining that the same skill appears in two sections because communication with the supervisor is relevant to both documentation practices and professional conduct.

### 5. q281 — Task Code Assignment
**Severity:** 🟡 Low  
**Item:** `q281` categorized under `E-02` (Actively seek clinical direction) asks what is outside the RBT's scope of practice.  
**Discussion:** While understanding scope relates to seeking clinical direction, this question is more directly about scope of practice itself. The RBT Task List covers scope implicitly across E-01 and E-02.  
**Recommendation:** No change needed — the question is educationally valid under E-02 since understanding scope is prerequisite to knowing when to seek direction.

### 6. fc013 — Graph Terminology
**Severity:** 🟡 Low  
**Item:** `fc013` uses the term "Equal-Interval Graphs (Line Graphs)"  
**Discussion:** The RBT Task List 2nd Edition (A-07) says "Describe the functions and components of a graph." The flashcard correctly covers this but could mention that cumulative records and bar graphs are also used in ABA (though line graphs are by far the most common for RBT-level work).  
**Recommendation:** Minor — consider adding a brief mention that other graph types exist but line graphs are the primary focus for the RBT exam.

### 7. q177 — Respondent Conditioning under B-07
**Severity:** 🟡 Low  
**Item:** `q177` about a child bitten by a dog (respondent conditioning) is categorized under `B-07` (discrimination training/stimulus control).  
**Discussion:** B-07 in the 2nd Edition Task List includes "Implement discrimination training and stimulus control transfer procedures." Respondent conditioning is tangentially related (it involves stimulus-response relationships) but is not a core B-07 topic. However, the Task List doesn't have a dedicated respondent conditioning code for RBTs, and understanding it is important for the exam.  
**Recommendation:** Acceptable placement. Consider noting in the explanation that respondent conditioning is foundational knowledge tested on the RBT exam even though it doesn't have its own dedicated task code.

## Content Coverage Analysis

### Task Code Coverage ✅

All task codes from the RBT Task List 2nd Edition are represented:

| Section | Task Codes | Covered? |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| A. Measurement | A-01 through A-07 | ✅ All covered |
| B. Skill Acquisition | B-01 through B-21 | ✅ All covered |
| C. Behavior Reduction | C-01 through C-04 | ✅ All covered |
| D. Documentation & Reporting | D-01 through D-05 | ✅ All covered |
| E. Professional Conduct | E-01 through E-10 | ✅ All covered |

### Question Distribution

| Category | Questions | % of Total |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| A. Measurement | ~50 | 16.7% |
| B. Skill Acquisition | ~105 | 35.0% |
| C. Behavior Reduction | ~55 | 18.3% |
| D. Documentation & Reporting | ~40 | 13.3% |
| E. Professional Conduct | ~50 | 16.7% |

**Note:** The BACB RBT exam weighting (2nd Edition) is approximately:
- A: 12% | B: 38% | C: 14% | D: 10% | E: 26%

The app's distribution is close but **Section E (Professional Conduct) is slightly underrepresented** relative to its 26% weight on the actual exam. Consider adding more E-section questions.

---

## Recommendations

### 1. Add More Section E Questions
The actual RBT exam weights Professional Conduct & Scope of Practice at ~26%. The app has ~16.7%. Consider adding 15-20 more E-section questions to better match exam proportions.

### 2. Add "Exam Simulation" Mode
With 300 questions, there's enough content for mock exams. A timed 85-question practice exam matching the real exam's category distribution would be highly valuable.

### 3. Verify Task List Edition Branding
Ensure the app refers to the "RBT Task List (2nd Edition)" — not the "5th Edition" (which is the BCBA task list).

### 4. Add Difficulty Levels
Some questions (e.g., q076 — four functions of behavior) are straightforward recall, while others (e.g., q168 — drawbacks of mass trialing) require deeper understanding. Tagging difficulty levels would help students focus their study.

### 5. Cross-Reference Overlapping Task Codes
D-03/E-01 and D-04/E-07 cover similar topics in different contexts. Adding cross-references would help students understand why similar content appears in multiple sections.

### 6. Add Questions on Less-Covered Topics
The following topics could use additional questions:
- **B-14 (Group contingencies):** Only 2 questions — add 3-4 more
- **B-21 (Matching-to-sample):** Only 2 questions — add 2-3 more
- **B-09 (Equivalence-based instruction):** Only 3 questions — add 2-3 more

### 7. Consider Adding Scenario Complexity
Many E-section questions follow a predictable pattern ("The RBT should report to their supervisor"). While correct, the real exam may present more nuanced scenarios with multiple plausible answers. Adding trickier distractors would better prepare students.

### 8. Flashcard-Question Alignment
All 154 flashcards have corresponding questions, which is excellent. Consider adding flashcards for concepts that appear in questions but don't have dedicated flashcards (e.g., demand fading, priming, environmental enrichment).

## Conclusion

This is a **high-quality, exam-ready content set**. All answers are correct, all explanations are accurate, and the coverage spans the full RBT Task List. The content would serve students well in preparing for the RBT certification exam. The recommendations above are enhancements, not corrections — the existing content has no errors that would cause a student to learn incorrect information.
