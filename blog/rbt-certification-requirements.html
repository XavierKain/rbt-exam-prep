    <h2 id="overview">Requirements Overview</h2>
    <p>The BACB requires the following to earn RBT certification:</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Requirement</th><th>Details</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td><strong>Minimum age</strong></td><td>18 years old</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Education</strong></td><td>High school diploma or equivalent (GED)</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Training</strong></td><td>40-hour RBT training program (BACB-approved curriculum)</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Competency assessment</strong></td><td>Completed by a BCBA, BCaBA, or BCBA-D</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Background check</strong></td><td>Through BACB-approved vendor</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Exam</strong></td><td>85-question computer-based exam (pass/fail)</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2 id="step1">Step 1: Meet Eligibility Requirements</h2>
    <p>Before starting the certification process, confirm you meet the basic eligibility criteria:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You must be <strong>at least 18 years old</strong></li>
      <li>You must have a <strong>high school diploma or GED</strong></li>
      <li>No college degree is required</li>
      <li>No prior experience in ABA is required (though helpful)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="step2">Step 2: Complete 40-Hour RBT Training</h2>
    <p>You must complete a <strong>40-hour training program</strong> that covers the content areas of the RBT Task List (currently the <a href="rbt-task-list-2nd-edition">2nd Edition</a>). The training must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be based on the <strong>BACB's RBT Task List</strong></li>
      <li>Be delivered or designed by a <strong>BCBA or BCBA-D</strong></li>
      <li>Include training on all task list areas: measurement, assessment, skill acquisition, behavior reduction, documentation, and professional conduct</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Where to Get 40-Hour RBT Training</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Employer-provided:</strong> Many ABA agencies provide free training to new hires</li>
      <li><strong>Online programs:</strong> Available from $50–$300 (e.g., Relias, BehaviorLive, ABA Rocks)</li>
      <li><strong>University programs:</strong> Some colleges offer RBT training as continuing education</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Training can be completed in person, online, or a combination of both. Most online programs take <strong>1–3 weeks</strong> to complete.</p>

    <h2 id="step3">Step 3: Pass the Competency Assessment</h2>
    <p>After completing training, you must pass a <strong>competency assessment</strong> conducted by a BCBA, BCaBA, or BCBA-D. This is a hands-on evaluation where you demonstrate your ability to perform RBT tasks.</p>
    <p>The assessment covers all areas of the RBT Task List and uses a standardized form provided by the BACB. You must score <strong>"competent"</strong> on each item. Learn more in our <a href="rbt-competency-assessment">RBT Competency Assessment guide</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="step4">Step 4: Complete Background Check</h2>
    <p>The BACB requires all RBT applicants to complete a <strong>criminal background check</strong> through their approved vendor. Key details:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cost: approximately <strong>$100</strong></li>
      <li>Processing time: <strong>1–3 weeks</strong></li>
      <li>The background check must be completed before you can sit for the exam</li>
      <li>Certain criminal convictions may affect eligibility (the BACB reviews on a case-by-case basis)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="step5">Step 5: Pass the RBT Exam</h2>
    <p>The final step is passing the <strong>RBT certification exam</strong>, administered by Pearson VUE:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>85 multiple-choice questions</strong> (75 scored, 10 unscored pilot items)</li>
      <li><strong>90-minute time limit</strong></li>
      <li>Available at <strong>Pearson VUE test centers</strong> or via <strong>online proctoring</strong></li>
      <li>Exam fee: <strong>$45</strong></li>
      <li>Pass rate: approximately <strong>80%</strong></li>
      <li>Results are available immediately after completion</li>
    </ul>
