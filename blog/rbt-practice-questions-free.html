      <span>❓ Practice Questions</span>
    </div>

    <p>The best way to prepare for the RBT exam is to <strong>practice with realistic questions</strong>. Below you'll find 50 multiple-choice questions organized by task list section, with detailed explanations for every answer.</p>

    <div class="key-takeaway">
      <strong>💡 How to Use This:</strong> Try answering each question before revealing the answer. Read the explanation even if you got it right — understanding <em>why</em> is more important than getting the right answer.
    </div>

    <span class="section-label">Section A: Foundations (Questions 1-8)</span>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>1. What is the primary goal of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA)?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>To diagnose behavioral disorders</li>
        <li>To understand and improve socially significant behaviors</li>
        <li>To prescribe medication for behavior problems</li>
        <li>To provide counseling services</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: B.</strong> ABA focuses on understanding and improving socially significant behaviors using evidence-based techniques. RBTs do not diagnose, prescribe medication, or provide counseling.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>2. Which of the following is an example of a socially significant behavior?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>A child tapping their fingers on a desk</li>
        <li>A child learning to request items using words</li>
        <li>A child looking out a window</li>
        <li>A child humming quietly</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: B.</strong> Socially significant behaviors are those that meaningfully improve the individual's life. Learning to communicate needs (manding) is socially significant because it increases independence.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>3. What are the three components of the "three-term contingency"?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Stimulus, response, consequence</li>
        <li>Antecedent, behavior, consequence</li>
        <li>Setting, behavior, outcome</li>
        <li>Prompt, response, reinforcement</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: B.</strong> The three-term contingency (ABC) consists of the Antecedent (what happens before), the Behavior, and the Consequence (what happens after). This is a foundational concept in ABA.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>4. Positive reinforcement involves:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Removing something to increase behavior</li>
        <li>Adding something to decrease behavior</li>
        <li>Adding something to increase behavior</li>
        <li>Removing something to decrease behavior</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: C.</strong> Positive reinforcement = adding a stimulus after a behavior that increases the future likelihood of that behavior. Example: giving a sticker after a child completes a task.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>5. Which of the following best describes negative reinforcement?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Punishing a behavior</li>
        <li>Removing an aversive stimulus to increase behavior</li>
        <li>Ignoring a behavior</li>
        <li>Adding an aversive stimulus to decrease behavior</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: B.</strong> Negative reinforcement involves removing something unpleasant to increase behavior. "Negative" means removal, "reinforcement" means the behavior increases. Example: turning off a loud alarm when a child sits down.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>6. An RBT should ALWAYS:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Design their own behavior intervention plans</li>
        <li>Work under the supervision of a BCBA</li>
        <li>Provide diagnoses to families</li>
        <li>Modify programs without consulting their supervisor</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: B.</strong> RBTs must always work under the supervision of a BCBA or BCaBA. They do not design interventions, provide diagnoses, or modify programs independently.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>7. What does the term "extinction" mean in ABA?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>A species dying out</li>
        <li>Withholding reinforcement for a previously reinforced behavior</li>
        <li>Punishing a behavior until it stops</li>
        <li>Gradually fading prompts</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: B.</strong> Extinction is the process of no longer providing reinforcement for a behavior that was previously reinforced. Over time, the behavior decreases.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>8. Which schedule of reinforcement provides reinforcement after every correct response?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Variable ratio</li>
        <li>Fixed interval</li>
        <li>Continuous reinforcement (CRF)</li>
        <li>Variable interval</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: C.</strong> Continuous reinforcement (CRF) means reinforcing every single correct response. It's best for teaching new behaviors.</div>
    </div>

    <span class="section-label">Section B: Assessment (Questions 9-16)</span>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>9. Which data collection method records whether a behavior occurred during a specific time interval?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Frequency recording</li>
        <li>Duration recording</li>
        <li>Interval recording</li>
        <li>Latency recording</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: C.</strong> Interval recording divides an observation period into equal time intervals and records whether the behavior occurred during each interval.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>10. A preference assessment is used to:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Determine the function of a behavior</li>
        <li>Identify potential reinforcers for an individual</li>
        <li>Measure the rate of a behavior</li>
        <li>Assess the severity of a behavior</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: B.</strong> Preference assessments help identify items, activities, or stimuli that may function as reinforcers for a specific individual.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>11. What is the difference between frequency and rate?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>They are the same thing</li>
        <li>Frequency is a count; rate is frequency divided by time</li>
        <li>Rate is a count; frequency is rate divided by time</li>
        <li>Frequency measures duration; rate measures latency</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: B.</strong> Frequency is simply the count of how many times a behavior occurs. Rate is frequency divided by the observation time (e.g., 10 responses per minute).</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>12. Duration recording measures:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>How many times a behavior occurs</li>
        <li>How long a behavior lasts</li>
        <li>How long before a behavior starts</li>
        <li>Whether a behavior occurred in an interval</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: B.</strong> Duration recording measures the total amount of time a behavior lasts from onset to offset.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>13. Latency recording measures:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>How long a behavior lasts</li>
        <li>The time between a stimulus and the start of a behavior</li>
        <li>How many times a behavior occurs</li>
        <li>The intensity of a behavior</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: B.</strong> Latency is the time from when a stimulus is presented (e.g., an instruction) to when the behavior begins.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>14. In a multiple stimulus without replacement (MSWO) preference assessment:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>All items are presented and the chosen item is replaced</li>
        <li>All items are presented and the chosen item is removed before the next trial</li>
        <li>Only two items are presented at a time</li>
        <li>Items are presented one at a time</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: B.</strong> In MSWO, all items are presented, the individual chooses one, and that item is removed from the array. This creates a hierarchy of preferences.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>15. ABC data collection stands for:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Assessment, Behavior, Charting</li>
        <li>Antecedent, Behavior, Consequence</li>
        <li>Analysis, Baseline, Condition</li>
        <li>Application, Behavior, Conclusion</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: B.</strong> ABC data collection records the Antecedent (what happened before), the Behavior, and the Consequence (what happened after) to help identify patterns and potential functions.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>16. Permanent product recording is best used when:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>You need to observe the behavior in real-time</li>
        <li>The behavior leaves a tangible outcome that can be measured later</li>
        <li>The behavior occurs too quickly to count</li>
        <li>You need to measure the intensity of a behavior</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: B.</strong> Permanent product recording measures the tangible results of a behavior (e.g., completed worksheets, items placed in a bin) without needing to observe the behavior directly.</div>
    </div>

    <span class="section-label">Section C: Skill Acquisition (Questions 17-30)</span>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>17. Discrete Trial Training (DTT) consists of:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Unstructured play with reinforcement</li>
        <li>An instruction, response, consequence, and inter-trial interval</li>
        <li>A natural environment teaching approach</li>
        <li>Modeling without prompts</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: B.</strong> DTT is a structured teaching method with clear components: the discriminative stimulus (instruction), the learner's response, a consequence (reinforcement or correction), and a brief pause between trials.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>18. Which prompt is MOST intrusive?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Gestural</li>
        <li>Verbal</li>
        <li>Physical (hand-over-hand)</li>
        <li>Visual</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: C.</strong> Physical prompts (hand-over-hand guidance) are the most intrusive. The prompt hierarchy from most to least intrusive: physical → model → gestural → verbal → visual.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>19. What is prompt fading?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Adding more prompts over time</li>
        <li>Gradually reducing the level of assistance to promote independence</li>
        <li>Removing all prompts at once</li>
        <li>Switching from one prompt type to another</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: B.</strong> Prompt fading is the systematic reduction of prompts so the learner becomes more independent. The goal is for the behavior to occur without any prompts.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>20. Chaining is used to teach:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Single-step behaviors</li>
        <li>Complex behaviors broken into smaller steps</li>
        <li>Social skills only</li>
        <li>Academic concepts only</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: B.</strong> Chaining teaches complex, multi-step behaviors (like hand washing or getting dressed) by breaking them into individual steps linked in a sequence.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>21. In forward chaining, you:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Teach the last step first</li>
        <li>Teach all steps at once</li>
        <li>Teach the first step first and prompt through the rest</li>
        <li>Only reinforce the final step</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: C.</strong> In forward chaining, the learner independently completes the first step and is prompted through the remaining steps. Once the first step is mastered, the second step is taught independently, and so on.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>22. Modeling as a prompt involves:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Physically guiding the learner</li>
        <li>Demonstrating the desired behavior for the learner to imitate</li>
        <li>Pointing to the correct answer</li>
        <li>Telling the learner what to do</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: B.</strong> Modeling means demonstrating the target behavior so the learner can observe and imitate it.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>23. Natural Environment Teaching (NET) differs from DTT because:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>It uses no reinforcement</li>
        <li>It takes place during naturally occurring activities and follows the learner's motivation</li>
        <li>It requires a clinical setting</li>
        <li>It only teaches language skills</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: B.</strong> NET uses the learner's natural motivation and interests within everyday activities. It's more flexible and child-led compared to the structured format of DTT.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>24. Generalization refers to:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Performing a behavior only in the training setting</li>
        <li>Performing a learned behavior across different settings, people, or materials</li>
        <li>Forgetting a previously learned skill</li>
        <li>Learning a new behavior from scratch</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: B.</strong> Generalization occurs when a learner demonstrates a skill in settings, with people, or using materials that are different from those used during training.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>25. A token economy is an example of:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Punishment</li>
        <li>Extinction</li>
        <li>Conditioned reinforcement</li>
        <li>Unconditioned reinforcement</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: C.</strong> Tokens are conditioned (learned) reinforcers that are exchanged for backup reinforcers. They gain their reinforcing value through pairing with preferred items or activities.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>26. Shaping involves:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Reinforcing successive approximations of a target behavior</li>
        <li>Teaching all steps of a behavior at once</li>
        <li>Using physical prompts only</li>
        <li>Punishing incorrect responses</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: A.</strong> Shaping reinforces behaviors that are progressively closer to the target behavior. It's used when the target behavior doesn't yet exist in the learner's repertoire.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>27. A discriminative stimulus (SD) signals that:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Punishment is available</li>
        <li>Reinforcement is available for a specific behavior</li>
        <li>No reinforcement is available</li>
        <li>The session is over</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: B.</strong> An SD signals that reinforcement is available if the correct behavior is performed. Example: a teacher saying "touch red" is the SD for the learner to touch the red card.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>28. Differential reinforcement of alternative behavior (DRA) involves:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Reinforcing the problem behavior on a different schedule</li>
        <li>Reinforcing an appropriate alternative behavior while withholding reinforcement for the problem behavior</li>
        <li>Punishing the problem behavior</li>
        <li>Reinforcing any behavior except the problem behavior</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: B.</strong> DRA reinforces a specific, appropriate alternative behavior that serves the same function as the problem behavior, while placing the problem behavior on extinction.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>29. Task analysis is:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>A type of data collection</li>
        <li>Breaking a complex skill into smaller, teachable steps</li>
        <li>A type of preference assessment</li>
        <li>A method of punishment</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: B.</strong> A task analysis breaks down a complex behavior into its component steps. It's used in chaining procedures to teach multi-step skills.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>30. Maintenance of a behavior means:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>The behavior only occurs with prompts</li>
        <li>The behavior continues to occur after training has ended</li>
        <li>The behavior occurs in new settings</li>
        <li>The behavior increases in frequency</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: B.</strong> Maintenance refers to the continuation of a learned behavior over time after formal training and reinforcement have been reduced or stopped.</div>
    </div>

    <span class="section-label">Section D: Behavior Reduction (Questions 31-38)</span>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>31. The four functions of behavior are:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Attention, escape, tangible, sensory</li>
        <li>Positive, negative, punishment, extinction</li>
        <li>Social, academic, behavioral, emotional</li>
        <li>Frequency, duration, intensity, latency</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: A.</strong> The four functions of behavior (SEAT/ACES) are: Sensory/Automatic, Escape, Attention, and Tangible. Every behavior serves at least one of these functions.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>32. A child screams every time they're asked to do math. The teacher removes the math worksheet. The screaming likely serves the function of:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Attention</li>
        <li>Escape</li>
        <li>Tangible</li>
        <li>Sensory</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: B.</strong> The child screams (behavior) and the demand is removed (consequence). Since the behavior results in removal of an aversive task, the function is escape/avoidance.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>33. Extinction burst refers to:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>A gradual decrease in behavior</li>
        <li>A temporary increase in the behavior when reinforcement is first withheld</li>
        <li>The behavior stopping immediately</li>
        <li>A new behavior appearing</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="answer"><strong>✓ Answer: B.</strong> An extinction burst is a temporary increase in the frequency, duration, or intensity of a behavior when reinforcement is first discontinued. This is normal and expected.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
