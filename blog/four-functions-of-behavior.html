    <p>One of the foundational principles of <a href="what-is-aba-therapy">applied behavior analysis (ABA)</a> is that <strong>all behavior serves a purpose</strong>. Understanding <em>why</em> a behavior occurs is essential for developing effective interventions. In ABA, behavior is maintained by one (or more) of <strong>four functions</strong>.</p>

    <p>This concept is heavily tested on the <a href="how-to-pass-rbt-exam">RBT exam</a> and is critical for daily practice as an RBT.</p>

    <h2 id="overview">The 4 Functions Overview (SEAT)</h2>
    <p>A helpful mnemonic for remembering the four functions is <strong>SEAT</strong>:</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Letter</th><th>Function</th><th>The Behavior Gets the Person...</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td><strong>S</strong></td><td>Sensory/Automatic</td><td>Internal stimulation (it feels good)</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>E</strong></td><td>Escape/Avoidance</td><td>Removal of something unpleasant</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>A</strong></td><td>Attention</td><td>Social interaction from others</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>T</strong></td><td>Tangible</td><td>Access to a desired item or activity</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>The first two are <strong>socially mediated</strong> (attention and tangible — they require another person). Escape can be socially mediated (someone removes the demand) or non-socially mediated. Automatic reinforcement is <strong>non-socially mediated</strong> (the behavior itself is reinforcing, no other person is needed).</p>

    <h2 id="attention">1. Attention (Social Reinforcement)</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Behavior is maintained by receiving attention, interaction, or a reaction from another person.</p>

    <p>Attention can take many forms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Eye contact</li>
      <li>Verbal reprimands ("Stop doing that!")</li>
      <li>Comfort (hugs, reassurance)</li>
      <li>Laughter</li>
      <li>Physical contact</li>
      <li>Peers looking at or talking about the behavior</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Examples of Attention-Maintained Behavior</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A child cries → parent picks them up and comforts them → crying increases when the child wants attention</li>
      <li>A student makes jokes in class → classmates laugh → joking increases</li>
      <li>A child hits their sibling → parent scolds them ("Don't hit!") → hitting continues because any attention is reinforcing</li>
      <li>A toddler throws food → parent reacts dramatically → food throwing increases</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Attention doesn't have to be positive. Negative attention (scolding, reprimanding) can still reinforce behavior.</p>

    <h2 id="escape">2. Escape/Avoidance</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Behavior is maintained by the removal, postponement, or avoidance of an aversive task, demand, activity, or situation.</p>

    <h3>Examples of Escape-Maintained Behavior</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A child screams during math → teacher sends them to the hallway → screaming increases during math (escape from work)</li>
      <li>A student puts their head down → teacher stops asking questions → head-down behavior increases</li>
      <li>A child has a tantrum when asked to clean up → parent does the cleaning → tantrums increase during clean-up time</li>
      <li>An employee calls in sick on presentation days → avoids presenting → sick-day pattern increases</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Escape-maintained behavior is maintained by <a href="reinforcement-vs-punishment-aba">negative reinforcement</a> — the behavior removes something unpleasant.</p>

    <h2 id="tangible">3. Access to Tangibles/Activities</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Behavior is maintained by obtaining a desired item, activity, or preferred event.</p>

    <h3>Examples of Tangible-Maintained Behavior</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A child screams in the store → parent buys them candy → screaming in stores increases</li>
      <li>A child grabs a toy from a peer → obtains the toy → grabbing increases</li>
      <li>A teenager has a tantrum → parent gives back their phone → tantrums increase when phone is taken away</li>
      <li>A child leads an adult by the hand to the cookie jar → gets a cookie → hand-leading increases</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="automatic">4. Automatic/Sensory Reinforcement</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Behavior is maintained by the sensory stimulation it produces, independent of social consequences. The behavior itself is reinforcing.</p>

    <h3>Examples of Automatically-Maintained Behavior</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A child rocks back and forth → the vestibular stimulation feels good → rocking continues</li>
      <li>A person hums a song while alone → the auditory feedback is pleasant → humming continues</li>
      <li>Hand-flapping → proprioceptive/visual stimulation → continues regardless of social context</li>
      <li>Scratching an itch → relief from discomfort → scratching continues</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Automatic reinforcement is the only function that doesn't require another person. If a behavior occurs at similar rates when the person is alone vs. with others, it may be automatically reinforced.</p>

    <p><strong>Important note:</strong> Many self-stimulatory behaviors (stimming) are part of neurodivergent individuals' self-regulation. Modern ABA practice respects that many automatically-reinforced behaviors are <strong>not harmful</strong> and should not be targeted for reduction unless they pose a safety risk or significantly interfere with learning.</p>

    <h2 id="identify">How to Identify the Function of Behavior</h2>
    <p>Identifying the function of a behavior is called <strong>functional behavior assessment (FBA)</strong>. The BCBA leads this process, but RBTs play a crucial role in data collection.</p>

    <h3>Methods of Assessment</h3>

    <h4>1. Indirect Assessment</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Interviews with parents, teachers, caregivers</li>
      <li>Rating scales (e.g., Motivation Assessment Scale — MAS, Functional Assessment Screening Tool — FAST)</li>
      <li>Record reviews</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Descriptive Assessment</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>ABC data collection:</strong> Recording Antecedents, Behaviors, and Consequences as they naturally occur</li>
      <li><strong>Scatterplot:</strong> Recording when behavior occurs across the day to identify patterns</li>
      <li><strong>Direct observation</strong> in natural settings</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Functional Analysis (FA)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>gold standard</strong> for identifying behavior function</li>
      <li>Involves systematically manipulating antecedents and consequences in controlled conditions</li>
      <li>Typically includes: <strong>attention, escape, tangible, and alone/control</strong> conditions</li>
      <li>Conducted by or under the close supervision of a BCBA</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Quick Identification Guide</h3>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>If the Behavior Tends to Occur When...</th><th>Likely Function</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Attention is diverted elsewhere</td><td>Attention</td></tr>
        <tr><td>A demand or task is presented</td><td>Escape</td></tr>
        <tr><td>A preferred item is visible but unavailable</td><td>Tangible</td></tr>
        <tr><td>The person is alone with nothing to do</td><td>Automatic/Sensory</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2 id="treatment">Function-Based Treatment</h2>
    <p>Once the function is identified, the BCBA designs <strong>function-based interventions</strong>:</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Function</th><th>Example Interventions</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td><strong>Attention</strong></td><td>Planned ignoring (extinction) + frequent positive attention for appropriate behavior; teach appropriate ways to request attention</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Escape</strong></td><td>Escape extinction (follow through with demands) + teach appropriate break requests; modify task difficulty; use high-probability request sequences</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Tangible</strong></td><td>Don't provide the item contingent on problem behavior + teach appropriate requesting (manding); use token economies</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Automatic</strong></td><td>Provide alternative sensory activities; environmental enrichment; response blocking (if behavior is dangerous); matched stimulation</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>The key principle: <strong>the intervention must match the function</strong>. An intervention designed for attention-maintained behavior won't work for escape-maintained behavior, and vice versa.</p>

    <h2 id="exam">RBT Exam Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Memorize SEAT:</strong> Sensory, Escape, Attention, Tangible</li>
      <li><strong>Read scenarios carefully:</strong> Look for what happens <em>before</em> and <em>after</em> the behavior</li>
      <li><strong>Focus on the consequence:</strong> What does the person GET or AVOID as a result of the behavior?</li>
      <li><strong>Remember: all behavior has a function.</strong> Even behavior that seems random serves a purpose</li>
      <li><strong>Automatic = no social mediation:</strong> If the scenario shows behavior occurring when the person is alone, think automatic</li>
      <li><strong>Negative attention is still attention:</strong> Scolding, redirecting, or even saying "no" can reinforce attention-maintained behavior</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>What are the 4 functions of behavior in ABA?</h3>
    <p>The 4 functions of behavior are: (1) <strong>Attention/Social</strong> — behavior occurs to gain attention, (2) <strong>Escape/Avoidance</strong> — behavior occurs to avoid a demand or situation, (3) <strong>Access to Tangibles/Activities</strong> — behavior occurs to obtain a desired item, and (4) <strong>Automatic/Sensory</strong> — behavior occurs because it is internally reinforcing. These are remembered using the acronym <strong>SEAT</strong>.</p>

    <h3>What does SEAT stand for in ABA?</h3>
    <p><strong>SEAT</strong> is a mnemonic for the 4 functions: <strong>S</strong> = Sensory/Automatic, <strong>E</strong> = Escape, <strong>A</strong> = Attention, <strong>T</strong> = Tangible. All behavior serves at least one of these four functions.</p>

    <h3>How do you determine the function of a behavior?</h3>
    <p>The function is determined through <strong>functional behavior assessment (FBA)</strong>, which includes: indirect methods (interviews, questionnaires), descriptive assessment (ABC data collection, direct observation), and functional analysis (systematic manipulation of conditions).</p>

    <h3>Can a behavior have more than one function?</h3>
    <p>Yes. A single behavior can serve <strong>multiple functions</strong> depending on the context. For example, a child may tantrum for attention in one situation and to escape a demand in another.</p>
