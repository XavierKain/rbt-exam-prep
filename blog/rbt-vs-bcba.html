    <h2>What Does an RBT Do?</h2>
    <p>RBTs are the <strong>front-line providers of ABA therapy</strong>. They work directly with clients (often children with autism) to implement behavior intervention plans designed by a BCBA.</p>

    <p>Day-to-day responsibilities include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Running therapy sessions (DTT, NET, play-based learning)</li>
      <li>Collecting data on behavior and skill acquisition</li>
      <li>Implementing behavior reduction strategies</li>
      <li>Communicating with the supervising BCBA</li>
      <li>Working with families to carry over skills at home</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Does a BCBA Do?</h2>
    <p>BCBAs are the <strong>supervisors and program designers</strong>. They assess clients, create individualized treatment plans, train RBTs, and oversee the entire therapeutic process.</p>

    <p>Day-to-day responsibilities include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Conducting assessments (FBAs, VB-MAPP, ABLLS)</li>
      <li>Writing behavior intervention plans</li>
      <li>Supervising and training RBTs</li>
      <li>Analyzing data and adjusting programs</li>
      <li>Meeting with families, schools, and other professionals</li>
      <li>Managing caseloads</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Salary Comparison</h2>
    <p>Salary varies significantly by location, setting, and experience:</p>

    <h3>RBT Salary</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>National average:</strong> $38,000 – $42,000/year ($18-20/hour)</li>
      <li><strong>Entry level:</strong> $33,000 – $36,000</li>
      <li><strong>Experienced:</strong> $40,000 – $48,000</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>BCBA Salary</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>National average:</strong> $78,000 – $88,000/year</li>

    <div class="key-takeaway">
      <strong>💡 Bottom Line:</strong> BCBAs earn roughly <strong>2x what RBTs earn</strong>. But RBT certification takes weeks while BCBA takes years. Many people start as an RBT to gain experience while pursuing their master's degree.
    </div>

    <h2>How to Become an RBT</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Have a high school diploma</strong> (or equivalent)</li>
      <li><strong>Complete a 40-hour training program</strong> — available online</li>
      <li><strong>Pass a background check</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Complete a competency assessment</strong> — observed by a BCBA</li>
      <li><strong>Pass the RBT exam</strong> — 85 questions, $50 fee</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Total timeline: <strong>4 to 8 weeks</strong> from start to certified.</p>

    <h2>How to Become a BCBA</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Earn a bachelor's degree</strong> (any field)</li>
      <li><strong>Complete a master's degree</strong> in behavior analysis, psychology, or education with BACB-approved coursework</li>
      <li><strong>Accumulate 1,500-2,000 supervised fieldwork hours</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Pass the BCBA exam</strong> — 185 questions, 4 hours</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Total timeline: <strong>2 to 4 years</strong> after bachelor's degree.</p>

    <h2>The Career Path: RBT → BCaBA → BCBA</h2>
    <p>Many successful BCBAs started as RBTs. Here's the typical career progression:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>RBT</strong> — Get certified, start working, gain hands-on experience</li>
      <li><strong>BCaBA (optional)</strong> — Board Certified Assistant Behavior Analyst, requires a bachelor's degree</li>
      <li><strong>BCBA</strong> — Full behavior analyst, requires a master's degree</li>
      <li><strong>BCBA-D (optional)</strong> — Doctoral-level board certification</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Starting as an RBT gives you <strong>invaluable clinical experience</strong> that will make you a better BCBA. Many graduate programs prefer applicants with RBT experience, and some employers offer tuition assistance for RBTs pursuing their master's degree.</p>

    <h2>Job Outlook</h2>
    <p>Both RBT and BCBA roles are in <strong>high demand</strong>. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects the ABA field to grow significantly due to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Increasing autism diagnoses</li>
      <li>Insurance mandates for ABA coverage in most states</li>
      <li>Growing awareness of ABA effectiveness</li>
      <li>Expansion into new populations (TBI, substance abuse, OBM)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="key-takeaway">
      <strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong> RBT positions rarely stay vacant long. If you're looking for a career change with low barrier to entry and immediate job prospects, RBT is one of the fastest paths. You can be working within 2 months of starting your training.
    </div>

    <h2>Which Should You Choose?</h2>
    <p><strong>Choose RBT if:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>You want to start working in ABA quickly</li>
      <li>You enjoy hands-on work with clients</li>
      <li>You want to "test the waters" before committing to a master's degree</li>
      <li>You're looking for a career change with a low barrier to entry</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Choose BCBA (or start planning for it) if:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>You want to design programs and lead a team</li>
      <li>Higher earning potential is important to you</li>
      <li>You're interested in research and clinical decision-making</li>
      <li>You want more professional autonomy</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Best strategy:</strong> Start as an RBT now, gain experience, and decide later if you want to pursue BCBA.</p>
