    <h2 id="general">General & Background Questions (1–5)</h2>

    <h3>1. What is ABA therapy and why did you choose this field?</h3>
    <p><strong>Model Answer:</strong> "ABA stands for Applied Behavior Analysis — it's a science-based approach to understanding and improving behavior. I chose this field because I'm passionate about making a meaningful difference in people's lives, especially children with autism. The combination of data-driven decision-making and direct client interaction appeals to me because I can see measurable progress over time."</p>
    <p><em>💡 Tip: Show genuine passion. Mention specific experiences that drew you to ABA — volunteering, a personal connection, or coursework.</em></p>

    <h3>2. What do you know about the role of an RBT?</h3>
    <p><strong>Model Answer:</strong> "An RBT is a paraprofessional who implements ABA treatment plans designed by a supervising BCBA. My responsibilities include running programs during therapy sessions, collecting accurate data on client behaviors, following behavior intervention plans, and maintaining professional and ethical conduct as outlined by the BACB. RBTs work under ongoing supervision — at least 5% of billable hours must be supervised."</p>
    <p><em>💡 Tip: Mentioning the supervision requirement shows you understand the RBT's scope of practice. See <a href="rbt-vs-bcba">RBT vs BCBA</a> for more on role differences.</em></p>

    <h3>3. Tell me about your experience working with children or individuals with disabilities.</h3>
    <p><strong>Model Answer:</strong> "I volunteered at a summer camp for children with developmental disabilities for two years, where I assisted with daily activities and behavioral support. This experience taught me patience, adaptability, and the importance of individualized approaches. I also completed my 40-hour RBT training, where I practiced implementing discrete trial training, preference assessments, and data collection procedures."</p>
    <p><em>💡 Tip: Even if you don't have direct ABA experience, highlight transferable skills from childcare, education, healthcare, or volunteer work.</em></p>

    <h3>4. Why do you want to work at our company specifically?</h3>
    <p><strong>Model Answer:</strong> "I researched your clinic and was impressed by your focus on naturalistic teaching and family involvement. I also appreciate that you offer structured supervision and professional development opportunities for RBTs. Your emphasis on ethical, evidence-based practice aligns with my values, and I'm excited about the opportunity to grow my skills here."</p>
    <p><em>💡 Tip: Always research the company beforehand. Mention specific programs, values, or reviews that attracted you.</em></p>

    <h3>5. What are your career goals in the ABA field?</h3>
    <p><strong>Model Answer:</strong> "In the short term, I want to become the best RBT I can be — building strong clinical skills and developing positive relationships with clients and families. Long-term, I'm considering pursuing a master's degree to become a BCBA. I want to gain hands-on experience as an RBT first because I believe direct implementation experience makes a better behavior analyst."</p>
    <p><em>💡 Tip: Employers love candidates who see the RBT role as a stepping stone. Even if you're not sure about becoming a BCBA, show growth mindset.</em></p>

    <h2 id="aba-knowledge">ABA Knowledge Questions (6–10)</h2>

    <h3>6. What are the four functions of behavior?</h3>
    <p><strong>Model Answer:</strong> "The four functions of behavior are: (1) <strong>Attention</strong> — seeking social interaction or reactions from others, (2) <strong>Escape/Avoidance</strong> — getting away from non-preferred tasks or situations, (3) <strong>Access to tangibles</strong> — obtaining preferred items or activities, and (4) <strong>Automatic/Sensory</strong> — the behavior itself produces reinforcement independent of others. Understanding the function is essential because it guides how we respond to the behavior."</p>
    <p><em>💡 Tip: Give a brief example for each function to show applied understanding. Read our full <a href="four-functions-of-behavior">guide on the four functions of behavior</a>.</em></p>

    <h3>7. Explain the difference between positive and negative reinforcement.</h3>
    <p><strong>Model Answer:</strong> "Both increase the likelihood of a behavior occurring again. <strong>Positive reinforcement</strong> adds something desirable — like praising a child after they follow an instruction. <strong>Negative reinforcement</strong> removes something aversive — like ending a difficult task when a child uses appropriate language to request a break. The key distinction is adding versus removing a stimulus, but both strengthen the behavior."</p>
    <p><em>💡 Tip: Many candidates confuse negative reinforcement with punishment. For a deep dive, see <a href="reinforcement-vs-punishment-aba">Reinforcement vs Punishment in ABA</a>.</em></p>

    <h3>8. What is discrete trial training (DTT)?</h3>
    <p><strong>Model Answer:</strong> "DTT is a structured teaching method used in ABA. Each trial has three parts: the antecedent (an instruction or stimulus), the learner's response, and the consequence (reinforcement for correct responses or a correction procedure for errors). There's a brief inter-trial interval between trials. DTT is particularly effective for teaching new skills in a structured setting."</p>
    <p><em>💡 Tip: Mention that DTT is just one ABA method — naturalistic teaching is also important. See our <a href="discrete-trial-training-guide">DTT guide</a> for more.</em></p>

    <h3>9. How do you conduct a preference assessment?</h3>
    <p><strong>Model Answer:</strong> "There are several methods. A <strong>free operant observation</strong> involves watching the client interact naturally with available items. A <strong>multiple stimulus without replacement (MSWO)</strong> presents several items, the client picks one, and that item is removed before the next choice. A <strong>paired stimulus assessment</strong> presents items two at a time. The results help identify potential reinforcers to use during therapy sessions. I always verify with the BCBA which method to use."</p>

    <h3>10. What is a behavior intervention plan (BIP) and what is the RBT's role?</h3>
    <p><strong>Model Answer:</strong> "A BIP is a written plan developed by a BCBA that outlines strategies for reducing problem behaviors and teaching replacement behaviors. It's based on a functional behavior assessment. As an RBT, my role is to <strong>implement the BIP as written</strong> — I follow the antecedent strategies, deliver consequences as specified, collect data accurately, and report any concerns to my supervisor. I do not modify the plan on my own."</p>

    <h2 id="scenarios">Behavioral Scenario Questions (11–15)</h2>

    <h3>11. A client is having a severe tantrum in a public setting. What do you do?</h3>
    <p><strong>Model Answer:</strong> "First, I ensure the <strong>safety</strong> of the client and anyone nearby — that's always the top priority. Then I follow the behavior intervention plan, which should address crisis situations. I remain calm and avoid inadvertently reinforcing the behavior (e.g., giving attention or giving in to demands). I would implement any crisis protocols in place and use trained de-escalation strategies. Afterward, I document everything accurately and debrief with my BCBA supervisor."</p>

    <h3>12. Your client is not making progress on a program after several weeks. What do you do?</h3>
    <p><strong>Model Answer:</strong> "I would first ensure my implementation is accurate by reviewing the program steps and asking my supervisor to observe a session. If I'm implementing correctly, I'd bring the concern to my BCBA with the data I've collected. The BCBA may need to modify the program — perhaps adjusting the prompt level, changing the reinforcer, or breaking the skill into smaller steps. The data guides the decision."</p>

    <h3>13. A client engages in self-injurious behavior (SIB). How do you respond?</h3>
    <p><strong>Model Answer:</strong> "I follow the BIP exactly as written for SIB. This typically involves blocking or redirecting to prevent injury while remaining calm. I would never use physical intervention beyond what I've been trained and authorized to do. Safety is the immediate priority. I collect data on the incident and report to my supervisor immediately. If there's no current plan for SIB, I contact my BCBA right away."</p>

    <h3>14. Describe a time you dealt with a difficult situation and how you handled it.</h3>
    <p><strong>Model Answer:</strong> "During a session, a client began exhibiting an escalation pattern I hadn't seen before — screaming, throwing materials, and attempting to elope. I stayed calm, ensured the environment was safe, and followed the crisis protocol. I used a neutral tone and gave the client space while blocking the exit. Once the client de-escalated, I resumed pairing before returning to demands. I documented everything and discussed it with my BCBA, who adjusted the antecedent strategies."</p>
    <p><em>💡 Tip: Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for behavioral questions.</em></p>

    <h3>15. How would you handle a session where the client refuses to participate?</h3>
    <p><strong>Model Answer:</strong> "I'd first consider why — are they tired, sick, overstimulated, or has the reinforcer lost its value? I'd try <strong>pairing</strong> — spending time doing preferred activities with no demands to rebuild rapport. I might try behavioral momentum by starting with easy, preferred tasks before transitioning to target programs. If refusal continues, I'd document the session and consult my BCBA about modifying the approach."</p>

    <h2 id="ethics">Ethics & Professionalism Questions (16–20)</h2>

    <h3>16. A parent asks you to change the treatment plan. What do you do?</h3>
    <p><strong>Model Answer:</strong> "I listen respectfully to the parent's concerns because they know their child best. However, I explain that as an RBT, I implement the treatment plan as written by the supervising BCBA and cannot modify it independently. I encourage the parent to discuss their concerns directly with the BCBA and offer to help facilitate that conversation. I also document the parent's feedback to share with my supervisor at our next supervision meeting."</p>

    <h3>17. You notice a coworker is not following a client's BIP correctly. What do you do?</h3>
    <p><strong>Model Answer:</strong> "This is a matter of treatment integrity, which directly affects client outcomes. I would first consider whether my coworker might not have been trained on a recent update. If appropriate, I might mention it casually — 'Hey, did you see the updated protocol?' If the issue continues or is more serious, I would report it to my supervisor. The BACB Ethics Code requires RBTs to report concerns that could affect client welfare."</p>

    <h3>18. How do you maintain professional boundaries with clients and families?</h3>
    <p><strong>Model Answer:</strong> "I maintain boundaries by keeping the relationship professional and focused on the client's treatment goals. I don't accept gifts beyond small tokens, I don't share personal social media with families, and I don't provide services outside of scheduled sessions without authorization. I follow my company's policies and the BACB Ethics Code. If a boundary issue arises, I discuss it with my supervisor."</p>

    <h3>19. What would you do if you witnessed a colleague being physically rough with a client?</h3>
    <p><strong>Model Answer:</strong> "I would intervene immediately to ensure the client's safety if needed. Then I would report the incident to my supervisor and follow my company's reporting procedures. This is a serious ethical violation, and I am <strong>mandated to report</strong> any abuse or neglect. I would document exactly what I observed — factual descriptions without interpretation — and cooperate fully with any investigation. Client safety is non-negotiable."</p>

    <h3>20. How do you handle burnout in the ABA field?</h3>
    <p><strong>Model Answer:</strong> "I prioritize self-care by maintaining boundaries between work and personal life. I use supervision sessions not just for clinical questions but also to discuss challenging cases and process difficult experiences. I celebrate small wins — when a client makes progress, I take a moment to recognize that. I stay connected with colleagues for peer support and continue professional development to stay engaged and motivated."</p>

    <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>What should I wear to an RBT interview?</h3>
    <p><strong>Business casual</strong> is typically appropriate. Choose clean, comfortable clothing you could potentially work in — many ABA positions involve sitting on the floor, moving around, and being physically active with clients. Avoid excessive jewelry, strong fragrances, and impractical shoes.</p>

    <h3>Do I need my RBT certification before interviewing?</h3>
    <p>Not necessarily. Many companies hire candidates who are in the process of getting certified and will support you through the <a href="rbt-certification-requirements">certification process</a>. However, having your certification or at least your 40-hour training completed gives you a competitive advantage.</p>

    <h3>How long does a typical RBT interview last?</h3>
    <p>Most RBT interviews last <strong>30–60 minutes</strong>. Some companies include a role-play scenario or a practical demonstration in addition to standard questions. Larger organizations may have multiple interview rounds.</p>

    <h3>What if I don't have any ABA experience?</h3>
    <p>Many RBT positions are entry-level and don't require prior ABA experience. Highlight transferable skills from childcare, education, healthcare, or volunteer work. Emphasize your willingness to learn, your completion of the 40-hour training, and your understanding of basic ABA concepts.</p>

    <h3>What salary should I expect as a new RBT?</h3>
    <p>RBT salaries vary by location and setting. Entry-level RBTs typically earn $18–$28/hour depending on the state. Check our <a href="rbt-salary-by-state">RBT salary by state guide</a> and the <a href="rbt-exam-pass-rate">exam pass rate statistics</a> for more career data.</p>
