    <h2 id="what-is">What Is the RBT Exam?</h2>
    <p>The RBT exam is a <strong>computer-based certification test</strong> administered by the Behavior Analyst Certification Board (BACB). It tests your knowledge of applied behavior analysis (ABA) concepts as they relate to the role of a Registered Behavior Technician.</p>
    <p>To be eligible, you need:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A high school diploma or equivalent</li>
      <li>Completion of a <strong>40-hour RBT training program</strong></li>
      <li>A background check</li>
      <li>A completed competency assessment</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="format">Exam Format & Structure</h2>
    <p>Here's exactly what you'll face on test day:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>85 multiple-choice questions</strong> (75 scored, 10 unscored pilot questions)</li>
      <li><strong>90-minute time limit</strong></li>
      <li><strong>4 answer choices</strong> per question</li>
      <li>Questions are based on the <strong>RBT Task List (2nd Edition)</strong></li>
      <li>You need approximately <strong>68% to pass</strong> (the exact cut score varies)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="key-takeaway">
      <strong>💡 Key Takeaway:</strong> You don't know which 10 questions are unscored, so treat every question as if it counts. Don't rush through any of them.
    </div>

    <h2 id="task-list">Understanding the RBT Task List (2nd Edition)</h2>
    <p>The RBT Task List (2nd Edition) is your exam blueprint. Every question comes from one of these sections:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>A. Foundations (12%)</strong> — ABA principles, ethics, professional conduct</li>
      <li><strong>B. Assessment (12%)</strong> — Data collection, preference assessments</li>
      <li><strong>C. Skill Acquisition (28%)</strong> — Teaching procedures, prompting, reinforcement</li>
      <li><strong>D. Behavior Reduction (12%)</strong> — Function-based interventions, extinction</li>
      <li><strong>E. Documentation and Reporting (12%)</strong> — Session notes, graphing data</li>
      <li><strong>F. Professional Conduct and Scope of Practice (24%)</strong> — Ethics, boundaries, supervision</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Notice that <strong>Skill Acquisition (28%)</strong> and <strong>Professional Conduct (24%)</strong> make up over half the exam. Focus your study time accordingly.</p>

    <h2 id="study-strategy">The Best Study Strategy</h2>
    <p>After talking to hundreds of RBT candidates, here's the study approach that works best:</p>

    <h3>1. Start with Flashcards (Week 1-2)</h3>
    <p>Go through the entire task list using flashcards. Don't try to memorize everything — focus on <strong>understanding concepts</strong>. Mark cards as "know it," "learning," or "need review."</p>

    <h3>2. Practice Questions (Week 2-3)</h3>
    <p>Switch to multiple-choice practice questions. The goal isn't just getting the right answer — it's understanding <strong>why the wrong answers are wrong</strong>. Read every explanation.</p>

    <h3>3. Mock Exams (Week 3-4)</h3>
    <p>Take full 85-question practice exams under timed conditions. This builds your stamina and helps you manage time on test day. Aim for <strong>80%+ consistently</strong> before scheduling your exam.</p>

    <h3>4. Review Weak Areas (Ongoing)</h3>
    <p>After each practice exam, identify the sections where you scored lowest. Go back to the flashcards for those topics. Repeat until there are no weak spots.</p>

    <div class="key-takeaway">
      <strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong> Study in <strong>25-minute focused sessions</strong> (Pomodoro technique). Short, intense sessions beat long, unfocused ones every time.
    </div>

    <h2 id="resources">Top Study Resources</h2>
    <p>You don't need to spend hundreds of dollars. Here are the best resources:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>RBT Exam Prep App</strong> — 154 flashcards, 300+ questions, exam simulator (<a href="/rbt-exam-prep/app/">try free</a>)</li>
      <li><strong>BACB Task List PDF</strong> — Free download from <a href="https://www.bacb.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bacb.com</a></li>
      <li><strong>Cooper, Heron & Heward</strong> — "Applied Behavior Analysis" textbook (the ABA bible)</li>
      <li><strong>YouTube</strong> — Free video explanations of ABA concepts</li>
      <li><strong>Your supervising BCBA</strong> — Ask questions during supervision sessions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="mistakes">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Only reading notes</strong> — Passive reading doesn't work. You need active recall (flashcards + practice questions).</li>
      <li><strong>Ignoring ethics questions</strong> — Professional conduct is 24% of the exam. Don't skip it.</li>
      <li><strong>Not timing practice exams</strong> — You have 90 minutes for 85 questions. That's about 1 minute per question. Practice under pressure.</li>
      <li><strong>Studying too much the day before</strong> — Rest your brain. Light review only.</li>
      <li><strong>Changing answers</strong> — Your first instinct is usually right. Only change an answer if you're certain it's wrong.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="exam-day">Exam Day Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Arrive 30 minutes early</strong> — You'll need time for check-in and ID verification.</li>
      <li><strong>Bring two forms of ID</strong> — One must be a government-issued photo ID.</li>
      <li><strong>Read each question twice</strong> — Look for keywords like "best," "first," "most likely."</li>
      <li><strong>Flag and skip</strong> — If a question stumps you, flag it and come back. Don't waste time.</li>
      <li><strong>Trust your preparation</strong> — If you've been scoring 80%+ on practice exams, you're ready.</li>
    </ul>

          <p itemprop="text">The exact passing score varies, but you generally need around <strong>68% correct</strong> on the scored questions (approximately 51 out of 75 scored questions). Since 10 questions are unscored pilot items, aim for at least 58 correct out of 85 total.</p>

          <p itemprop="text">Most candidates study for <strong>2 to 4 weeks</strong>, spending 1-2 hours per day. If you're already working as an RBT under supervision, you may need less time since you're applying concepts daily.</p>
