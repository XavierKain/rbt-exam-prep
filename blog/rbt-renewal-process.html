    <p>Your <strong>RBT certification</strong> doesn't last forever — it must be renewed every year. Missing your renewal deadline means you can't legally practice as a Registered Behavior Technician. This guide walks you through the entire renewal process so you stay compliant and certified.</p>

    <h2 id="overview">Renewal Requirements Overview</h2>
    <p>The BACB requires the following for annual RBT renewal:</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Requirement</th><th>Details</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td><strong>Frequency</strong></td><td>Annually (every 12 months)</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Competency assessment</strong></td><td>Annual re-assessment by a BCBA/BCaBA</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Ongoing supervision</strong></td><td>Minimum 5% of hours spent providing ABA services</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Renewal fee</strong></td><td>$35/year</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Continuing education</strong></td><td>Not required by BACB (but recommended)</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Background check</strong></td><td>Not required annually (only at initial certification)</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2 id="step1">Step 1: Complete Ongoing Supervision</h2>
    <p>Throughout your certification year, you must receive <strong>ongoing supervision</strong> from a qualified supervisor (BCBA, BCaBA under BCBA oversight, or BCBA-D):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Supervision must equal at least <strong>5% of the total hours</strong> you spend providing ABA services</li>
      <li>Supervision must include <strong>direct observation</strong> of you working with clients</li>
      <li>Supervision contacts must occur at least <strong>twice per month</strong></li>
      <li>At least <strong>one supervision contact per month</strong> must include direct observation (in person or via telehealth)</li>
      <li>Your supervisor must document all supervision contacts</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you work 120 hours per month providing ABA services, you need at least 6 hours of supervision per month (120 × 5% = 6 hours).</p>

    <h2 id="step2">Step 2: Pass Annual Competency Assessment</h2>
    <p>Before renewing, you must complete a new <strong>competency assessment</strong>. This is similar to the initial <a href="rbt-competency-assessment">competency assessment</a> you completed when first getting certified:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Must be conducted by your supervising <strong>BCBA, BCaBA, or BCBA-D</strong></li>
      <li>Uses the BACB's standardized <strong>RBT Competency Assessment form</strong></li>
      <li>Covers all areas of the <a href="rbt-task-list-2nd-edition">RBT Task List</a></li>
      <li>You must be rated <strong>"competent"</strong> on all items</li>
      <li>Must be completed <strong>within the certification cycle</strong> (before your expiration date)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="step3">Step 3: Submit Renewal Application</h2>
    <p>To submit your renewal:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Log in to your <strong>BACB account</strong> at bacb.com</li>
      <li>Navigate to your <strong>certification management</strong> page</li>
      <li>Confirm your competency assessment is on file</li>
      <li>Attest that you've met all supervision requirements</li>
      <li>Complete the renewal application form</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="step4">Step 4: Pay the Renewal Fee</h2>
    <p>The RBT annual renewal fee is <strong>$35</strong>, payable online through the BACB portal. Payment is required to complete the renewal process.</p>

    <h2 id="deadlines">Important Deadlines</h2>
    <p>Your renewal deadline is based on your <strong>initial certification date</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The BACB sends email reminders <strong>90 days, 60 days, and 30 days</strong> before your expiration date</li>
      <li>You can submit your renewal as early as <strong>60 days before</strong> your expiration date</li>
      <li>There is a <strong>30-day grace period</strong> after expiration, but you cannot practice as an RBT during this period</li>
      <li>After the grace period, your certification is <strong>officially lapsed</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Set a calendar reminder for 90 days before your expiration date. Don't rely solely on BACB emails.</p>

    <h2 id="lapsed">What If Your Certification Lapses?</h2>
    <p>If you miss the renewal deadline and grace period:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You <strong>cannot practice as an RBT</strong> or represent yourself as certified</li>
      <li>If it's been <strong>less than 30 days</strong> past expiration: you may still renew with a late fee</li>
      <li>If it's been <strong>more than 30 days</strong>: you may need to complete the full certification process again (training, competency assessment, background check, exam)</li>
      <li>Contact the BACB directly if you're in a lapse situation — they can advise on your specific case</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="tips">Tips for a Smooth Renewal</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Track your supervision hours</strong> throughout the year — don't scramble at renewal time</li>
      <li><strong>Schedule your competency assessment early</strong> — at least 2 months before your expiration date</li>
      <li><strong>Keep your BACB account information current</strong> — especially your email address</li>
      <li><strong>Set multiple calendar reminders</strong> for your renewal deadline</li>
      <li><strong>Communicate with your supervisor</strong> — make sure they know your renewal timeline</li>
      <li><strong>Keep copies of all supervision documentation</strong> — the BACB may audit you</li>
    </ol>
