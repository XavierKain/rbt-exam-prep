    <h1>15 RBT Exam Tips You Need to Know Before Test Day</h1>

      <span>🎓 Exam Day</span>
    </div>

    <p>You've done the studying. You know your reinforcement from your punishment. But the exam itself has its own quirks. These <strong>15 tips from people who already passed</strong> will give you the edge on test day.</p>

    <h2>Before the Exam</h2>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3><span class="tip-number">1</span> Book your exam date FIRST</h3>
      <p>Schedule your exam before you feel "ready." Having a fixed date creates urgency and prevents endless procrastination. Most people need 2-4 weeks of study — not 2-4 months.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3><span class="tip-number">2</span> Take at least 2 full mock exams</h3>
      <p>Don't just do practice questions — take full 85-question timed exams. This builds stamina and teaches you pacing. If you're consistently scoring 80%+, you're ready.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3><span class="tip-number">3</span> Focus on Sections C and F</h3>
      <p>Skill Acquisition (28%) and Professional Conduct (24%) make up over half the exam. If you're short on time, prioritize these. Ethics questions are often the trickiest.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3><span class="tip-number">4</span> Don't cram the night before</h3>
      <p>Your brain consolidates information during sleep. Do a light 20-minute review at most, then relax. Watch something fun. Go to bed early. Cramming the night before causes more harm than good.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3><span class="tip-number">5</span> Prepare your logistics in advance</h3>
      <p>Know exactly where the testing center is, what ID you need (two forms, one photo), and how long it takes to get there. Arrive 30 minutes early. Remove one source of stress before it starts.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>During the Exam</h2>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3><span class="tip-number">6</span> Read every question TWICE</h3>
      <p>The RBT exam loves keywords like "best," "first," "most likely," and "least appropriate." These words completely change the answer. Read carefully before looking at the choices.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3><span class="tip-number">7</span> Eliminate wrong answers first</h3>
      <p>You can usually rule out 1-2 obviously wrong answers immediately. This turns a 1-in-4 guess into a 1-in-2 guess. Even if you're unsure, elimination dramatically improves your odds.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3><span class="tip-number">8</span> Flag and move on</h3>
      <p>If a question stumps you for more than 60 seconds, flag it and move on. Come back to it at the end with fresh eyes. Don't let one hard question steal time from three easy ones.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3><span class="tip-number">9</span> Trust your first answer</h3>
      <p>Research consistently shows that your first instinct is usually correct. Only change an answer if you have a clear, specific reason — not just anxiety. "I feel like it might be C" is not a reason to change from B.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3><span class="tip-number">10</span> For ethics questions: protect the client</h3>
      <p>When in doubt on a professional conduct question, pick the answer that best protects the client's welfare, maintains boundaries, and follows your BCBA's guidance. "Consult your supervisor" is usually a safe bet.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3><span class="tip-number">11</span> Watch for "absolutes"</h3>
      <p>Answers with words like "always," "never," "all," or "none" are usually wrong. ABA is nuanced — there are almost always exceptions. Answers with "usually," "typically," or "most likely" tend to be more accurate.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3><span class="tip-number">12</span> Manage your time</h3>
      <p>85 questions in 90 minutes = about 1 minute per question. Check in at question 40 — you should be around the 45-minute mark. If you're falling behind, pick up the pace on easier questions.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Managing Test Anxiety</h2>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3><span class="tip-number">13</span> Breathe. Literally.</h3>
      <p>If you feel panic rising, stop and take 3 slow, deep breaths. 4 seconds in, hold for 4, out for 6. This activates your parasympathetic nervous system and actually calms your brain. It's not woo-woo — it's physiology.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3><span class="tip-number">14</span> Remember: 80% of people pass</h3>
      <p>The RBT exam is challenging but very passable. You don't need a perfect score — you need roughly 68%. That means you can get nearly a third of the questions wrong and still pass. Breathe.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tip">
      <h3><span class="tip-number">15</span> You can retake it</h3>
      <p>If the worst happens, you can retake the exam. It's $50 and a few weeks of extra studying. It's not the end of the world. Ironically, knowing you can retake it often reduces anxiety enough to help you pass the first time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="key-takeaway">
      <strong>💡 The #1 Tip:</strong> Preparation is the best anxiety reducer. If you've gone through the flashcards, taken practice quizzes, and scored 80%+ on mock exams, you are ready. Trust the process.
    </div>

    <h2>Quick Exam Day Checklist</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Two forms of ID (one government-issued photo ID)</li>
      <li>✅ Confirmation email / appointment details</li>
      <li>✅ Arrive 30 minutes early</li>
      <li>✅ Water and a snack (for before/after — nothing allowed in the testing room)</li>
      <li>✅ Comfortable clothing (testing rooms can be cold)</li>
      <li>✅ A positive mindset — you've prepared, and you've got this</li>
    </ul>
