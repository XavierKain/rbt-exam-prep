    <h2 id="top">Top 10 Highest-Paying States for RBTs</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>New Jersey</strong> — $46,000/year</li>
      <li><strong>California</strong> — $45,500/year</li>
      <li><strong>Washington, D.C.</strong> — $44,500/year</li>
      <li><strong>Massachusetts</strong> — $44,000/year</li>
      <li><strong>New York</strong> — $43,500/year</li>
      <li><strong>Connecticut</strong> — $42,500/year</li>
      <li><strong>Washington</strong> — $42,000/year</li>
      <li><strong>Hawaii</strong> — $41,000/year</li>
      <li><strong>Alaska</strong> — $40,200/year</li>
      <li><strong>Rhode Island</strong> — $40,000/year</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Keep in mind that higher salaries often correlate with higher cost of living. An RBT earning $46,000 in New Jersey may have similar purchasing power to one earning $33,000 in Mississippi.</p>

    <h2 id="factors">Factors That Affect RBT Pay</h2>

    <h3>1. Geographic Location</h3>
    <p>As the table above shows, location is the single biggest factor. States with higher costs of living, larger populations of children with autism, and stronger insurance mandates for ABA therapy tend to pay more.</p>

    <h3>2. Work Setting</h3>
    <p>RBTs work in several settings, each with different pay structures:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>In-home ABA therapy:</strong> Often the most common. Pay ranges from $16–$25/hour.</li>
      <li><strong>Clinic-based ABA:</strong> Typically offers more consistent hours and may include benefits. $17–$24/hour.</li>
      <li><strong>Schools:</strong> School-based RBT positions may offer lower hourly rates but include benefits like summers off, health insurance, and retirement plans.</li>
      <li><strong>Hospitals and residential facilities:</strong> Less common but may offer the highest hourly rates ($19–$28/hour).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Experience Level</h3>
    <p>Experience significantly impacts RBT compensation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>0–1 years:</strong> $15–$18/hour (entry-level)</li>
      <li><strong>1–3 years:</strong> $17–$21/hour</li>
      <li><strong>3–5 years:</strong> $19–$24/hour</li>
      <li><strong>5+ years:</strong> $21–$28/hour</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Employer Type</h3>
    <p>Large national ABA companies (like Trumpet Behavioral Health, Centria Autism, or Behavior Analysis Inc.) may offer different compensation packages than small local practices. Larger companies often provide better benefits; smaller companies may offer higher hourly rates.</p>

    <h3>5. Specialization and Additional Certifications</h3>
    <p>RBTs who pursue additional training — such as crisis intervention certification, specialization in early intervention, or bilingual skills — can command higher pay.</p>

    <h2 id="increase">How to Increase Your RBT Salary</h2>

    <p>If you're looking to earn more as an RBT, consider these strategies:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Gain experience.</strong> Even 1–2 years of hands-on ABA therapy experience can significantly increase your pay.</li>
      <li><strong>Pursue additional certifications.</strong> Crisis prevention (CPI), CPR/First Aid, or specialized ABA training adds value.</li>
      <li><strong>Work toward becoming a BCaBA or BCBA.</strong> The biggest salary jump comes from advancing your education. BCaBAs earn $45,000–$55,000, and BCBAs earn $60,000–$90,000+ annually. Learn more in our <a href="rbt-vs-bcba">RBT vs BCBA comparison</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Negotiate.</strong> Many RBTs don't negotiate their starting salary. Research the going rate in your area and ask for what you're worth.</li>
      <li><strong>Consider relocation.</strong> Moving to a higher-paying state or metro area can increase your income by 20–40%.</li>
      <li><strong>Be bilingual.</strong> ABA agencies serving diverse populations often pay a premium for bilingual RBTs, especially Spanish-English speakers.</li>
    </ol>
