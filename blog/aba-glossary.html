    <p><strong>ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis)</strong> — A scientific discipline that applies principles of learning and behavior to improve socially significant behaviors. ABA is the most widely researched intervention for autism spectrum disorder.</p>

    <p><strong>ABC Data (Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence)</strong> — A method of data collection that records what happens before a behavior (antecedent), the behavior itself, and what happens after (consequence). Used in <a href="four-functions-of-behavior">functional behavior assessments</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Abolishing Operation (AO)</strong> — A motivating operation that decreases the reinforcing effectiveness of a stimulus. For example, eating a large meal is an AO for food as a reinforcer.</p>

    <p><strong>Acquisition</strong> — The process of learning a new behavior or skill. Measured by increasing correct responses over time.</p>

    <p><strong>Antecedent</strong> — Any event, stimulus, or condition that occurs immediately before a behavior. Antecedents can evoke or set the occasion for behavior.</p>

    <p><strong>Antecedent Intervention</strong> — A proactive strategy that modifies the environment before a behavior occurs to prevent problem behavior or increase desired behavior.</p>

    <p><strong>Assent</strong> — An individual's verbal or non-verbal agreement to participate in an activity or intervention. Especially important with clients who cannot provide legal consent.</p>

    <p><strong>Automatic Reinforcement</strong> — Reinforcement that occurs independent of the social environment; the behavior itself produces the reinforcing consequence (e.g., hand-flapping producing sensory stimulation).</p>

    <h2 id="b">B</h2>

    <p><strong>BACB (Behavior Analyst Certification Board)</strong> — The organization that credentials behavior analysts (BCBA, BCaBA) and behavior technicians (RBT). Learn about <a href="rbt-certification-requirements">RBT certification requirements</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Backward Chaining</strong> — A teaching procedure where the last step in a task analysis is taught first, and the learner completes only that step independently while the instructor completes all prior steps.</p>

    <p><strong>Baseline</strong> — The level of behavior before any intervention is applied. Baseline data serves as a comparison point to evaluate treatment effectiveness.</p>

    <p><strong>BCBA (Board Certified Behavior Analyst)</strong> — A master's-level professional certified to design and supervise ABA programs. See <a href="rbt-vs-bcba">RBT vs BCBA comparison</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Behavior</strong> — Any observable and measurable action performed by an organism. In ABA, behavior must be defined in objective terms.</p>

    <p><strong>Behavior Intervention Plan (BIP)</strong> — A written plan developed by a BCBA that describes specific strategies for reducing problem behavior and increasing replacement behaviors.</p>

    <p><strong>Behavior Reduction</strong> — Procedures designed to decrease the frequency, duration, or intensity of a target behavior.</p>

    <p><strong>Behavioral Contrast</strong> — A change in behavior in one setting that is opposite to the change in another setting, typically occurring when reinforcement conditions differ between settings.</p>

    <p><strong>Conditioned Stimulus (CS)</strong> — In respondent conditioning, a previously neutral stimulus that acquires the ability to elicit a response after being paired with an unconditioned stimulus.</p>

    <p><strong>Consequence</strong> — An event that follows a behavior and may affect its future probability. Consequences can be reinforcing or punishing.</p>

    <p><strong>Contingency</strong> — The relationship between a behavior and its consequence. A contingency specifies the conditions under which a consequence will be delivered.</p>

    <p><strong>Continuous Reinforcement (CRF)</strong> — A schedule of reinforcement in which every instance of the target behavior is reinforced. Best used during skill acquisition.</p>

    <p><strong>Contriving</strong> — Intentionally arranging the environment to create opportunities for a target behavior to occur.</p>

    <p><strong>Correction Procedure</strong> — A systematic method for responding to errors during instruction, typically involving re-presenting the trial with additional prompting.</p>

    <p><strong>Deprivation</strong> — A condition in which an individual has had limited access to a reinforcer, increasing its value as a motivating operation.</p>

    <p><strong>Differential Reinforcement</strong> — A procedure that combines reinforcement for desired behavior with extinction or reduced reinforcement for undesired behavior. Types include DRA, DRI, DRO, and DRL.</p>

    <p><strong>DRA (Differential Reinforcement of Alternative Behavior)</strong> — Reinforcing a specific alternative behavior while withholding reinforcement for the problem behavior.</p>

    <p><strong>DRI (Differential Reinforcement of Incompatible Behavior)</strong> — Reinforcing a behavior that is physically incompatible with the problem behavior.</p>

    <p><strong>Elopement</strong> — Leaving a designated area without permission. A common target behavior in ABA interventions for safety reasons.</p>

    <p><strong>Errorless Learning (Errorless Teaching)</strong> — A teaching strategy that uses immediate, full prompts to minimize errors during skill acquisition, then systematically fades prompts.</p>

    <p><strong>Establishing Operation (EO)</strong> — A motivating operation that increases the reinforcing effectiveness of a stimulus and evokes behaviors that have been reinforced by that stimulus. For example, food deprivation is an EO for food.</p>

    <p><strong>Extinction</strong> — The discontinuation of reinforcement for a previously reinforced behavior, resulting in a gradual decrease in that behavior.</p>

    <p><strong>Extinction Burst</strong> — A temporary increase in the frequency, duration, or intensity of a behavior immediately after reinforcement is withheld. A normal part of the extinction process.</p>

    <p><strong>Incidental Teaching</strong> — A naturalistic teaching strategy where the instructor uses the learner's interests and initiations as opportunities to teach new skills in the natural environment.</p>

    <p><strong>Independent Variable</strong> — The treatment or intervention being applied. In ABA, the independent variable is the procedure you implement to change behavior.</p>

    <p><strong>Inter-Observer Agreement (IOA)</strong> — A measure of the extent to which two or more independent observers agree on the occurrence of a behavior. High IOA indicates reliable data collection.</p>

    <p><strong>Inter-Response Time (IRT)</strong> — The amount of time between two consecutive instances of a behavior.</p>

    <p><strong>Inter-Trial Interval (ITI)</strong> — The pause between discrete trials in DTT. Allows the learner a brief break before the next trial begins.</p>

    <p><strong>Negative Reinforcement</strong> — Removing an aversive stimulus following a behavior, resulting in an increase in that behavior (e.g., fastening a seatbelt to stop the beeping).</p>

    <p><strong>Noncontingent Reinforcement (NCR)</strong> — Delivering reinforcement on a fixed or variable time schedule regardless of behavior. Used to reduce motivation for problem behavior.</p>

    <p><strong>Operant Behavior</strong> — Behavior that is controlled by its consequences (reinforcement or punishment). Most behaviors targeted in ABA are operant behaviors.</p>

    <p><strong>Operant Conditioning</strong> — The process by which behavior is modified by its consequences. Developed by B.F. Skinner as the foundation of ABA.</p>

    <p><strong>Overcorrection</strong> — A behavior reduction procedure involving restitution (restoring the environment to a better-than-original state) and/or positive practice (repeatedly practicing the correct behavior).</p>

    <p><strong>Premack Principle</strong> — The principle that a high-probability behavior can be used to reinforce a low-probability behavior (e.g., "First finish your work, then you can play").</p>

    <p><strong>Probe</strong> — A test trial conducted without prompts or reinforcement to assess whether a learner can perform a skill independently.</p>

    <p><strong>Prompt</strong> — An added stimulus that increases the likelihood of a correct response. Types include verbal, gestural, model, physical, positional, and visual prompts.</p>

    <p><strong>Prompt Dependency</strong> — When a learner becomes reliant on prompts and does not respond independently. Avoided through systematic prompt fading.</p>

    <p><strong>Replacement Behavior</strong> — A socially appropriate behavior taught to replace a problem behavior that serves the same function.</p>

    <p><strong>Respondent Behavior</strong> — Behavior that is automatically elicited by a stimulus (e.g., salivating in response to food). Also called reflexive behavior.</p>

    <p><strong>Respondent Conditioning (Classical Conditioning)</strong> — The process by which a neutral stimulus acquires the ability to elicit a response through pairing with an unconditioned stimulus (Pavlov's experiments).</p>

    <p><strong>Response Cost</strong> — A type of negative punishment in which a specified amount of a reinforcer is removed contingent on a problem behavior (e.g., losing tokens in a token economy).</p>

    <p><strong>Social Validity</strong> — The extent to which target behaviors, procedures, and outcomes are considered acceptable and meaningful by the client, their family, and society.</p>

    <p><strong>Spontaneous Recovery</strong> — The reappearance of a behavior that had previously been reduced through extinction, without any apparent reintroduction of reinforcement.</p>

    <p><strong>Stimulus Control</strong> — When a behavior occurs more frequently in the presence of a specific stimulus than in its absence (i.e., the behavior is "under the control" of that stimulus).</p>

    <p><strong>Stimulus Control Transfer</strong> — Shifting control of a behavior from a prompt to the natural antecedent stimulus through prompt fading.</p>

    <p><strong>Stimulus Discrimination</strong> — Responding differently to two or more stimuli (e.g., stopping at a red light but going at a green light).</p>

    <p><strong>Stimulus Equivalence</strong> — A phenomenon in which untrained relations between stimuli emerge after certain relations are trained (reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity).</p>

    <p><strong>Stimulus Generalization</strong> — When a behavior occurs in the presence of stimuli that are similar to, but different from, the original training stimulus.</p>

    <p><strong>Stimulus Prompt</strong> — Altering the properties of a stimulus (size, color, position) to increase the likelihood of a correct response.</p>

    <p><strong>Successive Approximations</strong> — Behaviors that increasingly resemble the target behavior, reinforced during shaping.</p>

    <h2 id="t">T</h2>

    <p><strong>Tact</strong> — A verbal operant in which the speaker labels or describes something in the environment (e.g., seeing a dog and saying "dog"). Controlled by a non-verbal stimulus.</p>

    <p><strong>Target Behavior</strong> — The specific behavior selected for change (increase or decrease) in a behavior intervention plan.</p>

    <p><strong>Task Analysis</strong> — Breaking a complex skill into smaller, sequential steps for teaching purposes. Used with chaining procedures.</p>

    <p><strong>Time-Out</strong> — A negative punishment procedure involving the temporary removal of access to reinforcement contingent on a problem behavior.</p>

    <p><strong>Token Economy</strong> — A reinforcement system where learners earn tokens (conditioned reinforcers) for desired behaviors and exchange them for backup reinforcers (preferred items/activities).</p>

    <p><strong>Topography</strong> — The physical form or shape of a behavior (e.g., how a person raises their hand).</p>

    <p><strong>Total Task Presentation</strong> — A chaining method in which the learner attempts every step of a task analysis during each session, with prompting provided as needed.</p>

    <p><strong>Trend</strong> — The direction of data points on a graph over time (increasing, decreasing, or stable). Used for making data-based decisions.</p>

    <p><strong>Trial</strong> — A single teaching opportunity consisting of an antecedent, response opportunity, and consequence.</p>

    <h2 id="u-v">U–V</h2>

    <p><strong>Unconditioned Reinforcer</strong> — A stimulus that is naturally reinforcing without prior learning (also called a primary reinforcer). Examples: food, water, warmth.</p>

    <p><strong>Unconditioned Stimulus (US)</strong> — In respondent conditioning, a stimulus that naturally and automatically triggers a response without any learning required.</p>

    <p><strong>Variable Interval (VI) Schedule</strong> — A schedule of reinforcement in which the first response after a variable, unpredictable amount of time is reinforced.</p>

    <p><strong>Variable Ratio (VR) Schedule</strong> — A schedule of reinforcement in which reinforcement is delivered after a variable number of responses. Produces high, steady rates of behavior (e.g., slot machines).</p>

    <p><strong>Verbal Behavior</strong> — B.F. Skinner's analysis of language as behavior, categorized into verbal operants including mand, tact, echoic, intraverbal, textual, and transcription.</p>

    <p><strong>Verbal Operant</strong> — A functional unit of language defined by its controlling variables. The six primary verbal operants are mand, tact, echoic, intraverbal, textual, and transcription.</p>

    <p><strong>Visual Schedule</strong> — A series of pictures, symbols, or words that represent activities in sequence. Used as an antecedent intervention to increase predictability and independence.</p>

    <p><strong>Visual Support</strong> — Any visual aid (picture, symbol, written word, video) used to support understanding, communication, or behavior. Commonly used in ABA programs.</p>

    <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>How many ABA terms do I need to know for the RBT exam?</h3>
    <p>The <strong>RBT Task List (2nd Edition)</strong> covers approximately 40–50 key concepts, but understanding 100+ terms gives you a stronger foundation. Many exam questions test your ability to apply terminology in real-world scenarios rather than just define them.</p>

    <h3>What is the difference between positive and negative reinforcement?</h3>
    <p><strong>Positive reinforcement</strong> adds a desirable stimulus after a behavior to increase it (e.g., giving praise after task completion). <strong>Negative reinforcement</strong> removes an aversive stimulus after a behavior to increase it (e.g., turning off a loud alarm when the person gets out of bed). Both increase the future likelihood of the behavior.</p>

    <h3>What is the ABC model in ABA?</h3>
    <p>The ABC model stands for <strong>Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence</strong>. It is the foundational framework for analyzing behavior in ABA. The antecedent is what happens before the behavior, the behavior is the observable action, and the consequence is what follows the behavior and affects whether it will happen again.</p>

    <h3>What are the four functions of behavior in ABA?</h3>
    <p>The <a href="four-functions-of-behavior">four functions of behavior</a> are: (1) <strong>Attention</strong> — behavior maintained by social attention, (2) <strong>Escape/Avoidance</strong> — behavior maintained by removal of demands, (3) <strong>Access to Tangibles</strong> — behavior maintained by obtaining preferred items, and (4) <strong>Automatic/Sensory</strong> — behavior maintained by sensory stimulation independent of social consequences.</p>

    <h3>What is the best way to study ABA terminology for the RBT exam?</h3>
    <p>Use flashcards with the term on one side and definition plus an example on the other. Practice applying terms to real-world scenarios. Study in short sessions using spaced repetition. Our <a href="/rbt-exam-prep/app/">free RBT practice app</a> includes terminology questions aligned with the RBT Task List (2nd Edition). Also check out our <a href="rbt-exam-study-schedule">4-week study schedule</a>.</p>
