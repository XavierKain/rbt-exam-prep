    <p>The <strong>RBT competency assessment</strong> is a required, hands-on evaluation that every RBT candidate must pass before sitting for the certification exam. Unlike the written exam, this assessment tests your ability to <em>perform</em> RBT skills in practice — not just know them in theory.</p>

    <h2 id="what">What Is the Competency Assessment?</h2>
    <p>The RBT competency assessment is a <strong>direct observation evaluation</strong> where a qualified assessor watches you demonstrate the skills from the <a href="rbt-task-list-2nd-edition">BACB RBT Task List (2nd Edition)</a>. It verifies that you can apply what you learned in your 40-hour training.</p>
    <p>There are two types:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Initial competency assessment:</strong> Required before you can take the RBT exam</li>
      <li><strong>Annual competency assessment:</strong> Required each year to <a href="rbt-renewal-process">renew your certification</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="who">Who Conducts It?</h2>
    <p>The assessment must be conducted by one of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>BCBA</strong> (Board Certified Behavior Analyst)</li>
      <li><strong>BCaBA</strong> (Board Certified Assistant Behavior Analyst) — under BCBA supervision</li>
      <li><strong>BCBA-D</strong> (BCBA with doctoral designation)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The assessor does <strong>not</strong> need to be your ongoing supervisor, but they often are. If your employer provides an RBT training program, they'll typically arrange the competency assessment as well.</p>

    <h2 id="skills">Skills Tested</h2>
    <p>The competency assessment covers all major areas of the RBT Task List:</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Task List Area</th><th>Examples of Skills Tested</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td><strong>A. Measurement</strong></td><td>Recording frequency, duration, and latency data; using data collection tools</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>B. Assessment</strong></td><td>Conducting preference assessments; assisting with functional behavior assessments</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>C. Skill Acquisition</strong></td><td>Running discrete trials; implementing prompting procedures; using reinforcement</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>D. Behavior Reduction</strong></td><td>Implementing behavior intervention plans; using differential reinforcement</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>E. Documentation & Reporting</strong></td><td>Writing session notes; graphing data; reporting to supervisor</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>F. Professional Conduct</strong></td><td>Maintaining professional boundaries; following the BACB Ethics Code</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2 id="format">Assessment Format</h2>
    <p>The assessor will use the <strong>BACB's standardized competency assessment form</strong>, which includes specific tasks you must demonstrate. Here's what to expect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The assessment typically takes <strong>1–3 hours</strong></li>
      <li>You may demonstrate skills with a <strong>real client</strong> or through <strong>role-play</strong> with the assessor</li>
      <li>The assessor observes and rates each skill as <strong>"competent"</strong> or <strong>"not competent"</strong></li>
      <li>You may be asked to explain your reasoning for certain procedures</li>
      <li>The assessor may create scenarios and ask you to respond appropriately</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="scoring">How It's Scored</h2>
    <p>Each item on the assessment is scored as either:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Competent:</strong> You demonstrated the skill correctly</li>
      <li><strong>Not Competent:</strong> You need additional training on this skill</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You must be rated <strong>"competent" on every item</strong> to pass. If you're rated "not competent" on any items, your assessor will provide feedback and you'll need additional practice before being reassessed on those specific skills.</p>

    <h2 id="prepare">How to Prepare</h2>

    <h3>1. Review the RBT Task List</h3>
    <p>Download the <a href="rbt-task-list-2nd-edition">RBT Task List 2nd Edition</a> from the BACB website and make sure you can explain and demonstrate every item.</p>

    <h3>2. Practice Skills with a Partner</h3>
    <p>Role-play with a colleague or classmate. Practice running discrete trials, taking data, implementing prompts, and using reinforcement.</p>

    <h3>3. Know Your Data Collection Methods</h3>
    <p>Be prepared to demonstrate:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Frequency/event recording</strong> — counting occurrences of behavior</li>
      <li><strong>Duration recording</strong> — timing how long a behavior lasts</li>
      <li><strong>Latency recording</strong> — measuring time between instruction and response</li>
      <li><strong>Interval recording</strong> — whole interval, partial interval, momentary time sampling</li>
      <li><strong>Permanent product recording</strong> — measuring tangible outcomes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Master Prompting Hierarchies</h3>
    <p>Know the different prompt types and when to use them:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Full physical prompt</strong> — hand-over-hand guidance</li>
      <li><strong>Partial physical prompt</strong> — light touch or nudge</li>
      <li><strong>Model prompt</strong> — demonstrating the correct response</li>
      <li><strong>Verbal prompt</strong> — giving a verbal hint or instruction</li>
      <li><strong>Gestural prompt</strong> — pointing or gesturing</li>
      <li><strong>Visual prompt</strong> — picture cues or written instructions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Understand Reinforcement Principles</h3>
    <p>Be ready to demonstrate delivering reinforcement correctly — immediately, consistently, and contingent on the target behavior. Know the difference between <a href="reinforcement-vs-punishment-aba">positive/negative reinforcement and punishment</a>.</p>

    <h3>6. Review Professional Conduct</h3>
    <p>Know the basics of the BACB Ethics Code as it applies to RBTs — confidentiality, professional boundaries, mandatory reporting, and working within your scope of competence.</p>

    </div>

    <h2 id="annual">Annual Renewal Assessment</h2>
    <p>The annual competency assessment for <a href="rbt-renewal-process">RBT renewal</a> follows the same format as the initial assessment:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Same standardized form from the BACB</li>
      <li>Same requirement to be rated "competent" on all items</li>
      <li>Must be completed by a BCBA, BCaBA, or BCBA-D</li>
      <li>Must be completed within your certification cycle (before your expiration date)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many RBTs complete their annual assessment during a regular supervision session with their BCBA.</p>
