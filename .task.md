# RBT Exam Prep — ABA Wizard Replacement

## Goal
A React web app to help people prepare for the RBT (Registered Behavior Technician) certification exam. Better than ABA Wizard (which sends wrong answers and crashes). Sell for $10 one-time on Gumroad.

## Context
- RBT = Registered Behavior Technician, a certification from BACB (Behavior Analyst Certification Board)
- ~50,000 new certifications per year in the USA
- Current market leader (ABA Wizard, $10) is buggy and has wrong answers
- Zero serious web-based competitors

## Core Features (MVP — 1 night)
1. **Flashcard mode**: flip through all RBT task list items (from BACB Task List, 5th edition — public domain)
   - Show term → click to reveal definition
   - Mark as "Know it" / "Still learning"
   - Track progress per session
2. **Quiz mode (MCQ)**: 10-50 questions per session
   - Multiple choice (4 options), randomized order
   - Immediate feedback: correct ✅ / wrong ❌ with explanation
   - Track score and review wrong answers at end
3. **Exam simulator**: 85 questions, 90-minute timer (matches real exam format)
   - Final score + breakdown by section
4. **Progress dashboard**: % mastered per category, streak days

## Content (RBT Task List 5th Edition — public domain)
Categories:
- A. Measurement (A-01 to A-07)
- B. Skill Acquisition (B-01 to B-21)
- C. Behavior Reduction (C-01 to C-04)
- D. Documentation & Reporting (D-01 to D-05)
- E. Professional Conduct & Scope of Practice (E-01 to E-10)

Build a `data/questions.ts` file with 100+ questions covering all categories. Research from public BACB materials and study guides.

## Tech Stack
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- TailwindCSS
- localStorage for progress persistence (no backend needed)
- No auth needed (one-time payment unlocks full app via simple key or just open access)
- Fully static → deploy on Vercel/Netlify for free

## Monetization
- $10 one-time via Gumroad
- Or: free with 20 questions, $10 to unlock all 100+
